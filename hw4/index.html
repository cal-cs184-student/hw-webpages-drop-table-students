		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<!-- Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole.
		Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework. -->

		In this homework, we experiment with physics and simulation. To start, we implemented a mesh of point masses
		connected by simulated springs to simulate a piece of cloth. Then, with this cloth, we simulate correctional and
		external forces on it by applying Hooke's Law to simulate springs, Verlet integration to calculate new positions
		over time, and constraining position updates to prevent unreasonable deformations. Next, we added support for
		mesh collision with spheres and planes. Then, we added support for self-collisions with help from spatial
		hashing. Finally, we created shaders using GLSL for diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping,
		displacement and bump mapping, and environment-mapped reflections.

		We learned that you cannot trust and intuitively rely on C++'s <code>std::vector</code> future memory location
		heuristics because the memory locations and its corresponding internal pointers may change due to resize. With
		mass computations comes mass memory (re)allocations, which can lead to fragile accessing methods.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<h3>Take some screenshots of <code>scene/pinned2.json</code> from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the
			cloth
			wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<h3>
			Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with
			<code>P</code>,
			modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <code>P</code> again. You can also restart the
			simulation at
			any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <code>R</code>.
		</h3>

		<p>
			In this section, we will experiment with the parameters in the simulation using
			<code>scene/pinned2.json</code>.
		</p>

		<h4>
			Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start
			to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? A high <code>ks</code>?
		</h4>

		<p>
			For a very low <code>ks</code> such as <code>ks=50</code>, the cloth appears to appear droopy — that is, the
			cloth deforms under forces more easily. We can see smoother and less defined folds, since the cloth is
			not resisting as much to all of the forces. As the cloth goes from start to rest, we can notice that there's
			a ripple effect that propagates across the entire cloth starting from the bottom once the bottom of the
			cloth hits its maximum. At rest, we observe that the bottom of the cloth is also droopy and not perfectly
			horizontal.
		</p>

			<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
				<code>scene/pinned2.json</code> in its final resting state with <code>ks=50</code> and default
				parameters otherwise
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			For a high <code>ks</code> such as <code>ks=50000</code>, the cloth appears to appear be more rigid —
			that is, the cloth better resists deformations under forces. We can see sharper and more defined folds in
			the cloth. From start to rest, the cloth appears to behave as more of a rigid unit, a stiffer substance,
			similar to a mudflap on a truck rather than an easily deformable cloth like a blanket. At rest, we also
			observe that the bottom of the cloth is almost perfectly horizontal as the increased stiffness of the cloth
			has dissipated the sag at the top of the cloth throughout faster.
		</p>

				parameters otherwise
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h4>
			What about for <code>density</code>?
		</h4>

		<p>
			For a very low <code>density</code> such as <code>density=1</code>, the cloth appears to sag less from start
			to finish. This is similar to the instance of high spring constant <code>ks</code> values, as in both
			situations the internal spring forces are dominant compared to external factors. In this case, the cloth
			sags less because gravity has less effect on the cloth as the cloth now has less mass from the lower density
			value.
		</p>

			<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
				<code>scene/pinned2.json</code> in its final resting state with <code>density=1</code> and default
				parameters otherwise
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			For a high <code>density</code> such as <code>density=1500</code>, the cloth appears to droop more from
			start to rest, similar to what we can observe with a low <code>ks</code>. However, the cloth is drooping not
			because it can't resist forces well, but because the external acceleration force of gravity is much, much
			higher to the point that the cloth droops.
		</p>

				parameters otherwise
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h4>
			What about for <code>damping</code>?
		</h4>

		<p>
			For a very low <code>damping</code> such as roughly <code>damping=5%</code>, the cloth takes longer to reach
			equilibrium. In reducing the damping value of the cloth, we are extracting energy out of the cloth at a
			lesser rate, letting the cloth move for longer. To use wave terms, the cloth is underdamped and oscillates.
		</p>

			<figcaption style="text-align: center;">
				<code>scene/pinned2.json</code> oscillating with roughly <code>damping=5%</code> and
				default parameters otherwise
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			For a high <code>damping</code> such as roughly <code>damping=70%</code>, the cloth takes longer to reach
			equilibrium. In reducing the damping value of the cloth, we are extracting energy out of the cloth at a
			lesser rate, letting the cloth move for longer. Due to the high damping factor, the cloth is sufficiently or
			overly damped, and it doesn't bounce back after reaching its equilibrium state.
		</p>

			and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<h3>
			Describe your implementation of handling collisions with spheres and planes.
		</h3>

		<p>
			Generally, calculating collisions in our <code>simulate</code> function for every point mass considering
			every collision object requires these steps:
			<br><br>
			Determine
			whether the new position will be colliding
			with the surface, and if so, figuring out where the new position should be — calculating the "tangent"
			point. The latter step usually also consists of calculating the distance between the point mass' position
			and the surface of the object. With different collision shapes come different algorithms to do these steps:
		</p>

		<h4>Spheres:</h4>
		<p>
			Determining whether a collision occurred consists of seeing if the new position is inside the sphere. This
			consists of checking whether the distance between the sphere's origin and the new point is less than the
			radius.
			<br><br>
			Calculating the tangent point is also relatively straightforward. The "tangent" point can be determined by
			tracing a ray from the origin of the sphere towards the point mass' position, but make the distance of this
			ray the radius of the sphere. We can then trace a ray from the point mass' previous point to this tangent
			point, and finally scale the ray down slightly due to friction to determine the final new position of the
			point mass.
		</p>

		<h4>Planes:</h4>
		<p>
			Determining whether a collision occurred consists of seeing if the new position is below the plane. To do
			so, we cast a ray from the plane's point towards the point mass and do a dot product with it and the
			plane's normal. If the result is negative, then the point mass is below the plane and we have a collision.
			<br><br>
			Calculating the "tangent" point in regards to a plane takes some more nuance compared to a sphere. Simply
			naively casting a ray "upwards" towards the direction of the plane will not entirely work as we then will
			have to do the ray-plane intersection setup again. Finding the tangential distance beforehand is crucial in
			this ray cast.
			<br><br>
			The projection of a ray gives us exactly this value — we first cast a ray from the plane's
			point towards the point mass, and we computed the dot product of this ray with the plane's normal vector,
			resulting in the projected length. Note that we have to negate this projected length to make it positive
			since the point mass' position is below the plane. Finally, we can cast a ray from the point mass with the
			direction of the plane's normal vector and with the projected length as the length of this ray. This then
			gives us the "tangent" point, which we offset by a constant <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code> so that the
			resulting point mass' position on the correct side of the plane (the side of the plane prior to the
			collision).
			<br><br>
			Then, like the sphere, we can then trace a ray from the point mass' previous point to this tangent point,
			and finally scale the ray down slightly due to friction to determine the final new position of the point
			mass.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from <code>scene/sphere.json</code> in its final resting state on
			the sphere
			using the default <code>ks = 5000</code> as well as with <code>ks = 500</code> and <code>ks = 50000</code>.
			Describe the differences in the results.

			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			As we increase the spring constant <code>ks</code>, the cloth becomes more stiff and resists the
			deformations as it rests on the sphere in its final resting state. The cloth acts as a rigid unit, a stiffer
			substance as mentioned in Part 2 above. This effect is especially pronunced when we look at the shaded cloth
			with <code>ks=50000</code>. Conversely, if we look at <code>ks=500</code>, the cloth conforms to the sphere
			more easily as opposed to a cloth with a higher spring constant.
		</p>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<h3>
			Describe your implementation of handling self-collisions.
		</h3>
		<p>
			A naive implementation of self-collisions consists of scanning through every point mass, then for each point
			mass compare it with every other point mass whether there's a collision. This is very slow, so we have
			encased these checks with a hash map with hashes generated from the 3D position of a point mass.
			<br><br>
			Before we run our self-collision checks, we have to first build the hash map. Our hash map's values are
			vectors -- these vectors will hold point mass pointers with close positions. We scan through every point
			mass, calculate its hash, and add it to these vectors, creating the vectors themselves if necessary.
			Additionally, we use <code>new</code> to initialize our vectors in the heap.
			<br><br>
			Now for our self-collision check: our implementation firstly still scans through every point mass. Then, for
			each point mass, we run our hash algorithm to get the hash of our point mass' position. Then, we use the map
			to retrieve the vector of point mass pointers corresponding to our point mass' hash.
			<br><br>
			Scanning through every point mass in this vector and skipping our own, we check if they are within
			<code>2 * thickness</code> apart. If they are, then we record the amount we need to move our point out of
			this range and sum up these values across all relevant point masses to take an average. Finally, we scale
			this average change by <code>simulation_steps</code> to reduce the potential number of sudden position
			corrections and improve our accuracy.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an
			early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still
			slightly bouncy on the ground).

		<h3>
			Vary the <code>density</code> as well as <code>ks</code> and describe with words and screenshots how they
			affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.
		</h3>
		<!-- default params 15 density, 5000 ks -->

		<p>
			If we set the spring constant to a high number such as <code>ks=50000</code> and keep the density at the
			default value, then we can observe that the cloth stays more rigid as it is folding on itself. The cloth
			appears to roll in on itself rather than scrunch up.

			such as <code>ks=50000</code> then we can observe that the cloth stays even more rigid as it is folding on
			itself. The cloth appears to roll in on itself even less since it's resisting more forces.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>
			Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to
			create lighting and material effects.
		</h3>

		<p>
			A shader program is a program run by the graphics pipeline to process and render graphics data. Generally,
			shader programs are structured to be highly parallelizable, leveraging on the computational power of
			graphics cards as well as the repetitiveness and repeating calculations done while rendering objects.

			Vertex shaders transform vertices — values like positions and normals, which it has access to — before
			rasterization. In manipulating these vertices following a certain design, one can add mesh-level textures
			which we perceive as material effects.

			Fragment shaders transform the color of the fragments we receive after rasterization. These types of shaders
			have direct control over the color this fragment will have, as well as access to geometric properties of
			each fragment. With these two power in mind, fragment shaders can vary the color of the fragment based on
			some other properties which we perceive as lighting effects.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader
			outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot
			only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
		</h3>

		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model combines three aspects of perceptual observations into a single model: ambient
			lighting, diffuse reflection, and specular highlights.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ambient lighting is the simplest component of the Blinn-Phong shading model. It represents the constant,
			omnipresent light in the scene that illuminates all objects equally, regardless of their position or
			orientation. This component is calculated as the product of the ambient light intensity \(I_a\) and the
			ambient coefficient \(k_a\).
		</p>

		<p>
			Diffuse reflection is the component of the Blinn-Phong shading model that simulates how light scatters when
			it hits a rough surface. It depends on the angle between the light source and the surface normal of the
			object. The
			intensity of the diffuse reflection is calculated using the Lambertian reflectance model, which is
			proportional to the cosine of the angle between the light direction and the surface normal. This is
			represented mathematically as \( L_d = k_d \cdot (\frac{I}{r^2}) \cdot \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l})
			\),
			where \(
			k_d \) is the diffuse coefficient, \( I \) is the light intensity, \( \mathbf{n} \) is the normalized
			surface normal, and \( \mathbf{l} \) is the normalized
			light direction. As we increase \(k_d\), the object gets more of a matte appearance.
		</p>

		<p>
			Specular highlights are the bright spots of light that appear on shiny surfaces when illuminated. They are
			calculated based on the angle between the viewer's direction and the reflection of the light source on the
			surface. The Blinn-Phong model uses the bisector vector (the normalized vector halfway between the light
			direction and the view direction) to calculate the specular component. This is represented mathematically as
			\( L_s = k_s \cdot (\frac{I}{r^2}) \cdot \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{h})^p \), where \( k_s \) is the
			specular coefficient, \( \mathbf{h} \) is the bisector vector, and \( p \) is the shininess factor. A high
			\( p \) value results in a smaller, sharper highlight, while a low \( p \) value produces a broader, softer
			highlight.

			Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. Show a screenshot of displacement mapping
			on the sphere. Use the same texture for both renders. You can either provide your own texture or use one of
			the ones in the textures directory, BUT choose one that's not the default <code>texture_2.png</code>.
			Compare the two
			approaches and resulting renders in your own words. Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by
			changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using <code>-o 16 -a 16</code> and then <code>-o 128 -a 128</code>.

		<p>
			For all renders, we set the <code>normal</code> parameter to 100 and the <code>height</code> parameter to
			0.05, which exaggerates the displacement for visualization purposes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Bump mapping modifies the normal vectors of an object based on the height map so that the fragment shader
			creates an illusion of depth without having to change the vertices. In contrast, displacement mapping
			modifies the position of the vertices in addition to the normal vectors of an object so that there is real a
			change in depth within the geometry. We can see the how the displacement mapping displaces the surface and
			edits the geometry in our renders, while bump mapping only creates an illusion of depth while still
			maintaining the smooth sphere shape and smooth cloth shape.
		</p>

		<p>
			As we change the mesh's coarseness by increasing <code>-o</code> and <code>-a</code>, we notice that there
			is little to no difference for bump mapping. However, for displacement mapping, we have a smoother and more
			detailed displacement on the surface of the mesh, whereas a low coarseness setting would show a more blocky
			and limit the detail of the displacement.
